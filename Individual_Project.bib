abstract = { A widely used form of an equation of state explicit in Helmholtz energy has been modified with new terms to eliminate certain undesirable characteristics in the two phase region. Modern multiparameter equations of state exhibit behavior in the two phase that is inconsistent with the physical behavior of fluids. The new functional form overcomes this dilemma and results in equations of state for pure fluids that are more fundamentally consistent. With the addition of certain nonlinear fitting constraints, the new equation now achieves proper phase stability, i.e., only one solution exists for phase equilibrium at a given state. New fitting techniques have been implemented to ensure proper extrapolation of the equation at low temperatures, in the vapor phase at low densities, and at very high temperatures and pressures. A formulation is presented for the thermodynamic properties of refrigerant 125 (pentafluoroethane, CHF2–CF3) using the new terms and fitting techniques. The equation of state is valid for temperatures from the triple point temperature (172.52 K) to 500 K and for pressures up to 60 MPa. The formulation can be used for the calculation of all thermodynamic properties, including density, heat capacity, speed of sound, energy, and saturation properties. Comparisons to available experimental data are given that establish the accuracy of calculated properties. The estimated uncertainties of properties calculated using the new equation are 0.1{\%} in density, 0.5{\%} in heat capacities, 0.05{\%} in the vapor phase speed of sound at pressures less than 1 MPa, 0.5{\%} in the speed of sound elsewhere, and 0.1{\%} in vapor pressure. Deviations in the critical region are higher for all properties except vapor pressure. },

abstract = {The temperature of hydrogen cylinder is limited to 85{\&}deg;C. However, there are temperature rise in fast filling of hydrogen storage cylinders which is related with filling parameters, geometric parameter, and thermodynamic parameter. In this paper, a theoretical analysis model for temperature rise in hydrogen fast filling process for composite hydrogen storage cylinders was establish. The temperature rise in adiabatic filling process for the cylinder was analyzed with the model and the settled temperature rise was obtained. The influence on temperature rise such as settled pressure, initial pressure, mass filling rate and initial temperature were analyzed with experimental and numerical simulation data. And their influence on temperature was found out. Based on the simulation results and experimental data, an accurate equation for temperature rise calculation of storage cylinder was put forward. Comparing with experimental data, the error of computed results is basically in 5{\%}. Furthermore, the control method for temperature rise was brought out by controlling the mass filling rate or the initial temperature.},

@article{Dicken2007,
abstract = {We have measured the effects of the initial mass and the total fill time on the temperature rise and the temperature distribution within a compressed hydrogen cylinder during refuelling. A type 3, 74 L hydrogen cylinder was instrumented internally with 63 thermocouples distributed along the mid vertical plane. The experimental fills were performed from initial pressures of 50, 75, 100, 150, and 200 bar at gas delivery rates corresponding to nominal fill times of 1, 3, and 6 min. The experimental conditions with larger ratios of final to initial mass produced larger temperature changes. However, the lower ratios generated the largest rates of temperature rise. Longer fill times produced lower final average gas temperatures (compared to shorter fills), and a temperature field with significant vertical stratification due to buoyancy forces at lower gas inlet velocities. A sensor located at the end opposite to the gas inlet could be suitable for fuel metering via temperature and pressure measurements only. {\&}copy; 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this research, experiments were performed to investigate the thermal behaviors such as temperature rise and distributions inside 35 MPa, 150 L hydrogen storage cylinders during its refueling. The main factors affecting the temperature rise in the fast fill process such as the mass filling rate and initial pressure in the cylinder were considered. The experimental results show that the mass filling rate is a constant when the ratio of the pressure in the tank to the cylinder is higher than 1.7, and the mass filling rate decreases when the ratio is lower than 1.7; the temperature inside the cylinder increases nonlinearly in the filling process and the maximum value of temperature rise at the interface of the cylinder exists in the caudal region; the temperature rise reaches a larger value with a lower initial pressure in the cylinder or a higher mass filling rate. Furthermore, the limit of mass filling rate in the case of different ambient temperature was obtained. {\&}copy; 2009 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu.},

abstract = {By taking the theoretical study of temperature rise within a hydrogen cylinder during a fast filling process and the complexity of a fast filling process with real hydrogen into consideration, a high-precision simulated model of a fast filling process had been build based upon the k-{\&}Epsilon; turbulence model of real gas. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software Fluent 13.0 was applied to simulate the refueling process within a filament wound composite hydrogen cylinder with aluminum liner. In order to study the effect of the length to diameter (L/D) radio and the inlet diameter of the cylinder on temperature rise and temperature distribution, numerical simulations were performed with different L/D radios such as 3.6 and 2.0. And to ascertain the effect of inlet diameter, cylinders with the inlet diameters of 16mm, 40mm, and 64mm were simulated as well. The results show that the larger ratio of L/D, the higher temperature rise within the cylinder. Similarly, the temperature rise within a larger inlet diameter cylinder is higher than that within a smaller inlet diameter cylinder.},
