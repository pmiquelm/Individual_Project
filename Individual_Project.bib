abstract = {By taking the theoretical study of temperature rise within a hydrogen cylinder during a fast filling process and the complexity of a fast filling process with real hydrogen into consideration, a high-precision simulated model of a fast filling process had been build based upon the k-{\&}Epsilon; turbulence model of real gas. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software Fluent 13.0 was applied to simulate the refueling process within a filament wound composite hydrogen cylinder with aluminum liner. In order to study the effect of the length to diameter (L/D) radio and the inlet diameter of the cylinder on temperature rise and temperature distribution, numerical simulations were performed with different L/D radios such as 3.6 and 2.0. And to ascertain the effect of inlet diameter, cylinders with the inlet diameters of 16mm, 40mm, and 64mm were simulated as well. The results show that the larger ratio of L/D, the higher temperature rise within the cylinder. Similarly, the temperature rise within a larger inlet diameter cylinder is higher than that within a smaller inlet diameter cylinder.},

abstract = {The temperature of hydrogen cylinder is limited to 85{\&}deg;C. However, there are temperature rise in fast filling of hydrogen storage cylinders which is related with filling parameters, geometric parameter, and thermodynamic parameter. In this paper, a theoretical analysis model for temperature rise in hydrogen fast filling process for composite hydrogen storage cylinders was establish. The temperature rise in adiabatic filling process for the cylinder was analyzed with the model and the settled temperature rise was obtained. The influence on temperature rise such as settled pressure, initial pressure, mass filling rate and initial temperature were analyzed with experimental and numerical simulation data. And their influence on temperature was found out. Based on the simulation results and experimental data, an accurate equation for temperature rise calculation of storage cylinder was put forward. Comparing with experimental data, the error of computed results is basically in 5{\%}. Furthermore, the control method for temperature rise was brought out by controlling the mass filling rate or the initial temperature.},

abstract = {Heat transfer to the wall of a small pressure vessel during filling with some different kinds of gas was investigated experimentally. The vessel was orientated vertically with the inlet at the top. The space-averaged Nusselt number for the curved wall was found to be a function of both the Reynolds and Rayleigh numbers indicating a mixed convection heat transfer situation. A correlation is proposed for the heat transfer coefficient during charging of the vessel. For the six positions where measurements were taken, the local heat transfer coefficient typically did not differ from the space-averaged value by more than about 30 percent. Measurements were also taken during discharging to atmospheric pressure. For discharging, some of the data was found to agree with a correlation for natural convection in cylindrical geometry. Local Nusselt numbers for discharging tended to be higher towards the bottom of the vessel.},

abstract = {We have measured the effects of the initial mass and the total fill time on the temperature rise and the temperature distribution within a compressed hydrogen cylinder during refuelling. A type 3, 74 L hydrogen cylinder was instrumented internally with 63 thermocouples distributed along the mid vertical plane. The experimental fills were performed from initial pressures of 50, 75, 100, 150, and 200 bar at gas delivery rates corresponding to nominal fill times of 1, 3, and 6 min. The experimental conditions with larger ratios of final to initial mass produced larger temperature changes. However, the lower ratios generated the largest rates of temperature rise. Longer fill times produced lower final average gas temperatures (compared to shorter fills), and a temperature field with significant vertical stratification due to buoyancy forces at lower gas inlet velocities. A sensor located at the end opposite to the gas inlet could be suitable for fuel metering via temperature and pressure measurements only. {\&}copy; 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The fast refueling of hydrogen results in a temperature rise, which may lead to the failure of the hydrogen storage cylinder. Hence, study of temperature rise during refueling is a significant concern regarding hydrogen safety. In this research, a well-design system for 70 MPa hydrogen refueling was developed. Several refueling experiments on a type III cylinder have been conducted to study the temperature rise during the refueling process on this system. The experimental results show that the gas in caudal region and the aft domes junction surface achieved the maximum temperature rise. A Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was also validated by the experimental results. Finally, effects of initial pressure and ambient temperature on temperature rise were studied using this model. The results show that with the increase of initial pressure and the decrease of the ambient temperature, the final gas temperature decreases approximately linearly. This pilot research can provide invaluable guidance in developing advanced refueling standard.},

abstract = {ISSN: 0145-7632 (Print) 1521-0537 (Online) Journal homepage: http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/uhte20 For fast and effective simulation of filling processes of pressure vessels with compressed gaseous media, the governing equations are derived from a mass balance equation for the gas and from energy balance equations for the gas and the wall of the vessel. The gas is considered as a perfectly mixed phase and two heat transfer coefficients are introduced. The first one is the mean heat transfer coefficient between the gas and the inner surface of the pressure vessel, and the second one is the heat transfer coefficient between outer surface of the vessel and the surroundings. Because of the heat capacity of the wall of the pressure vessel, heat transfer from the compressed gas to the vessel wall strongly influences the temperature field of the gas. Until now no correlations have been available for the heat transfer coefficient between inflowing gas and inner surface of the vessel. To solve this problem, a computational fluid dynamics tool is used to determine the gas velocities at the vicinity of the inner surface of the vessel for a number of discrete surface elements. The results of a large amount of numerical experiments show that there exists a unique relationship between the gas velocity at the inlet and the tangential fluid velocities at the vicinity of the inner surface of the vessel for each vessel geometry. Once this unique relationship is known, the complete velocity distribution at the vicinity of the inner surface can be easily calculated from the inlet gas velocity. The near-wall velocities at the outer limit of the boundary layer are substituted into the heat transfer correlation for external flow over flat plates. The final heat transfer coefficient is the area-weighted mean of all local heat transfer coefficients. The method is applied to the special case of filling with hydrogen a 70-MPa composite vessel for fuel cell vehicles.},

The main factors affecting the temperature rise in the fast fill process such as the mass filling rate and initial pressure in the cylinder were considered. The experimental results show that the mass filling rate is a constant when the ratio of the pressure in the tank to the cylinder is higher than 1.7, and the mass filling rate decreases when the ratio is lower than 1.7; the temperature inside the cylinder increases nonlinearly in the filling process and the maximum value of temperature rise at the interface of the cylinder exists in the caudal region; the temperature rise reaches a larger value with a lower initial pressure in the cylinder or a higher mass filling rate. Furthermore, the limit of mass filling rate in the case of different ambient temperature was obtained. {\&}copy; 2009 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu.},

abstract = { A widely used form of an equation of state explicit in Helmholtz energy has been modified with new terms to eliminate certain undesirable characteristics in the two phase region. Modern multiparameter equations of state exhibit behavior in the two phase that is inconsistent with the physical behavior of fluids. The new functional form overcomes this dilemma and results in equations of state for pure fluids that are more fundamentally consistent. With the addition of certain nonlinear fitting constraints, the new equation now achieves proper phase stability, i.e., only one solution exists for phase equilibrium at a given state. New fitting techniques have been implemented to ensure proper extrapolation of the equation at low temperatures, in the vapor phase at low densities, and at very high temperatures and pressures. A formulation is presented for the thermodynamic properties of refrigerant 125 (pentafluoroethane, CHF2–CF3) using the new terms and fitting techniques. The equation of state is valid for temperatures from the triple point temperature (172.52 K) to 500 K and for pressures up to 60 MPa. The formulation can be used for the calculation of all thermodynamic properties, including density, heat capacity, speed of sound, energy, and saturation properties. Comparisons to available experimental data are given that establish the accuracy of calculated properties. The estimated uncertainties of properties calculated using the new equation are 0.1{\%} in density, 0.5{\%} in heat capacities, 0.05{\%} in the vapor phase speed of sound at pressures less than 1 MPa, 0.5{\%} in the speed of sound elsewhere, and 0.1{\%} in vapor pressure. Deviations in the critical region are higher for all properties except vapor pressure. },
