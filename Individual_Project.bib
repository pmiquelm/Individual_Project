abstract = {A modified form of the Redlich-Kwong two-parameter equation of state is presented. The modified equation employs the acentric factor and the critical point compressibility factor as additional parameters to improve its accuracy and to extend its application range to include the critical point. This modified equation is as simple as the original form, yet achieves substantially better prediction accuracy, including thermodynamic parameters such as enthalpy and entropy. Results from this equation, the original equation, and three other popular modified forms are compared with gas property data for several compounds to demonstrate its improved accuracy and increased application range. Practical application limits to the other modified forms are identified to guide current users of those methods.},

abstract = {Gas with high pressure is widely used at present as fuel storage mode for different hydrogen vehicles. Different types of materials are used for constructing these hydrogen pressure vessels. An aluminum lined vessel and typically carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) materials are commercially used in hydrogen vessels. An aluminum lined vessel is easy to construct and posses high thermal conductivity compared to other commercially available vessels. However, compared to CFRP lined vessel, it has low strength capacity and safety factors. Therefore, nowadays, CFRP lined vessels are becoming more popular in hydrogen vehicles. Moreover, CFRP lined vessel has an advantage of light weight. CFRP, although, has many desirable properties in reducing the weight and in increasing the strength, it is also necessary to keep the material temperature below 85 {\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}C for maintaining stringent safety requirements. While filling process occurs, the temperature can be exceeded due to the compression works of the gas flow. Therefore, it is very important to optimize the hydrogen filling system to avoid the crossing of the critical limit of the temperature rise. Computer-aided simulation has been conducted to characterize the hydrogen filling to optimize the technique. Three types of hydrogen vessels with different volumes have been analyzed for optimizing the charging characteristics of hydrogen to test vessels. Gas temperatures are measured inside representative vessels in the supply reservoirs (H2 storages) and at the inlet to the test tank during filling.},

abstract = {Heat transfer to the wall of a small pressure vessel during filling with some different kinds of gas was investigated experimentally. The vessel was orientated vertically with the inlet at the top. The space-averaged Nusselt number for the curved wall was found to be a function of both the Reynolds and Rayleigh numbers indicating a mixed convection heat transfer situation. A correlation is proposed for the heat transfer coefficient during charging of the vessel. For the six positions where measurements were taken, the local heat transfer coefficient typically did not differ from the space-averaged value by more than about 30 percent. Measurements were also taken during discharging to atmospheric pressure. For discharging, some of the data was found to agree with a correlation for natural convection in cylindrical geometry. Local Nusselt numbers for discharging tended to be higher towards the bottom of the vessel.},

@article{Heitsch2011,
abstract = {High-pressure storage of hydrogen in tanks is a promising option to provide the necessary fuel for transportation purposes. The fill process of a high-pressure tank should be reasonably short but must be designed to avoid too high temperatures in the tank. The shorter the fill should be the higher the maximum temperature in the tank climbs. For safety reasons an upper temperature limit is included in the requirements for refillable hydrogen tanks (ISO 15869) which sets the limit for any fill optimization. It is crucial to understand the phenomena during a tank fill to stay within the safety margins. The paper describes the fast filling process of hydrogen tanks by simulations based on the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code CFX. The major result of the simulations is the local temperature distribution in the tank depending on the materials of liner and outer thermal insulation. Different material combinations (type III and IV) are investigated. Some measurements from literature are available and are used to validate the approach followed in CFX to simulate the fast filling of tanks. Validation has to be continued in the future to further improve the predictability of the calculations for arbitrary geometries and material combinations.},

The experimental fills were performed from initial pressures of 50, 75, 100, 150, and 200 bar at gas delivery rates corresponding to nominal fill times of 1, 3, and 6 min. The experimental conditions with larger ratios of final to initial mass produced larger temperature changes. However, the lower ratios generated the largest rates of temperature rise. Longer fill times produced lower final average gas temperatures (compared to shorter fills), and a temperature field with significant vertical stratification due to buoyancy forces at lower gas inlet velocities.

abstract = { A widely used form of an equation of state explicit in Helmholtz energy has been modified with new terms to eliminate certain undesirable characteristics in the two phase region. Modern multiparameter equations of state exhibit behavior in the two phase that is inconsistent with the physical behavior of fluids. The new functional form overcomes this dilemma and results in equations of state for pure fluids that are more fundamentally consistent. With the addition of certain nonlinear fitting constraints, the new equation now achieves proper phase stability, i.e., only one solution exists for phase equilibrium at a given state. New fitting techniques have been implemented to ensure proper extrapolation of the equation at low temperatures, in the vapor phase at low densities, and at very high temperatures and pressures. A formulation is presented for the thermodynamic properties of refrigerant 125 (pentafluoroethane, CHF2âCF3) using the new terms and fitting techniques. The equation of state is valid for temperatures from the triple point temperature (172.52 K) to 500 K and for pressures up to 60 MPa. The formulation can be used for the calculation of all thermodynamic properties, including density, heat capacity, speed of sound, energy, and saturation properties. Comparisons to available experimental data are given that establish the accuracy of calculated properties. The estimated uncertainties of properties calculated using the new equation are 0.1{\%} in density, 0.5{\%} in heat capacities, 0.05{\%} in the vapor phase speed of sound at pressures less than 1 MPa, 0.5{\%} in the speed of sound elsewhere, and 0.1{\%} in vapor pressure. Deviations in the critical region are higher for all properties except vapor pressure. },

Alternative rates of pressure rise, adiabatic and cold filling are investigated to evaluate the effect on maximum hydrogen temperatures inside the tank. Results confirmed that the developed CFD model could be a suitable tool for investigating fast filling scenarios when experimental data are not yet available or of difficult realization.},

abstract = {ISSN: 0145-7632 (Print) 1521-0537 (Online) Journal homepage: http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/uhte20 For fast and effective simulation of filling processes of pressure vessels with compressed gaseous media, the governing equations are derived from a mass balance equation for the gas and from energy balance equations for the gas and the wall of the vessel. The gas is considered as a perfectly mixed phase and two heat transfer coefficients are introduced. The first one is the mean heat transfer coefficient between the gas and the inner surface of the pressure vessel, and the second one is the heat transfer coefficient between outer surface of the vessel and the surroundings. Because of the heat capacity of the wall of the pressure vessel, heat transfer from the compressed gas to the vessel wall strongly influences the temperature field of the gas. Until now no correlations have been available for the heat transfer coefficient between inflowing gas and inner surface of the vessel. To solve this problem, a computational fluid dynamics tool is used to determine the gas velocities at the vicinity of the inner surface of the vessel for a number of discrete surface elements. The results of a large amount of numerical experiments show that there exists a unique relationship between the gas velocity at the inlet and the tangential fluid velocities at the vicinity of the inner surface of the vessel for each vessel geometry. Once this unique relationship is known, the complete velocity distribution at the vicinity of the inner surface can be easily calculated from the inlet gas velocity. The near-wall velocities at the outer limit of the boundary layer are substituted into the heat transfer correlation for external flow over flat plates. The final heat transfer coefficient is the area-weighted mean of all local heat transfer coefficients. The method is applied to the special case of filling with hydrogen a 70-MPa composite vessel for fuel cell vehicles.},

abstract = {This paper describes the development of thermal models for the filling of high pressure hydrogen tanks with experimental validation. Two models are presented; the first uses a one-dimensional, transient, network flow analysis code developed at Sandia National Labs, and the second uses the commercially available CFD analysis tool Fluent. These models were developed to help assess the safety of Type IV high pressure hydrogen tanks during the filling process. The primary concern for these tanks is due to the increased susceptibility to fatigue failure of the liner caused by the fill process. Therefore, a thorough understanding of temperature changes of the hydrogen gas and the heat transfer to the tank walls is essential. The effects of initial pressure, filling time, and fill procedure were investigated to quantify the temperature change and verify the accuracy of the models. In this paper we show that the predictions of mass averaged gas temperature for the one and three-dimensional models compare well with the experiment and both can be used to make predictions for final mass delivery. Due to buoyancy and other three-dimensional effects, however, the maximum wall temperature cannot be predicted using one-dimensional tools alone which means that a three-dimensional analysis is required for a safety assessment of the system.},

Ideal gas and real gas simulations are compared and the entropy balance of the filling process is formulated. Calculated results are validated for a type I tank (steel vessel) with measurements. The simulation is used to accurately predict the maximum gas temperature during the refueling of pressurized gaseous hydrogen storages, which must not exceed 85Â Â°C according to international standards. The influences of ambient temperature, initial pressure and pressure ramp rate on the resulting hydrogen gas temperature in the tank are investigated. In experiments, the effect of pressure pulses applied in practice on the resulting gas temperature is investigated as is the influence of the JouleâThomson effect of hydrogen and methane. Finally simulations and experimental results are used to develop a refueling protocol for hydrogen powered industrial trucks, in operation at Europe's first indoor hydrogen filling station in Linz, Austria.},

The temperature rise in adiabatic filling process for the cylinder was analyzed with the model and the settled temperature rise was obtained. The influence on temperature rise such as settled pressure, initial pressure, mass filling rate and initial temperature were analyzed with experimental and numerical simulation data. And their influence on temperature was found out. Based on the simulation results and experimental data, an accurate equation for temperature rise calculation of storage cylinder was put forward. Comparing with experimental data, the error of computed results is basically in 5{\%}. Furthermore, the control method for temperature rise was brought out by controlling the mass filling rate or the initial temperature.},

Hence, study of temperature rise during refueling is a significant concern regarding hydrogen safety. In this research, a well-design system for 70 MPa hydrogen refueling was developed. Several refueling experiments on a type III cylinder have been conducted to study the temperature rise during the refueling process on this system. The experimental results show that the gas in caudal region and the aft domes junction surface achieved the maximum temperature rise. A Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was also validated by the experimental results. Finally, effects of initial pressure and ambient temperature on temperature rise were studied using this model. The results show that with the increase of initial pressure and the decrease of the ambient temperature, the final gas temperature decreases approximately linearly. This pilot research can provide invaluable guidance in developing advanced refueling standard.},

Hence, thermal characteristics of a Type IV cylinder during hydrogen filling process need to be understood. In this study, a series of experiments were conducted to quantify the temperature change of the cylinder during hydrogen filling to 35 MPa. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was also conducted to simulate the conditions of the experiments. The results predicted by the CFD analysis show reasonable agreement with the experiments and the discrepancy between the CFD results and experimental results decrease with higher initial gas pressures. The upper and the lower parts of the vessel showed a temperature difference in the vertical direction. The upper gas temperature was higher than that of the lower part due to the buoyancy effect in the vessel. The maximum gas temperature was higher than the maximum temperature allowed in the ISO safety code (85 Â°C) for the case in which the vessel was pressurized from 0 MPa to 35 MPa. This work contributes to the understanding of the thermal flow characteristics of the hydrogen filling process and notes that additional efforts should be made to guarantee the safety of a type IV cylinder during the hydrogen fueling process.},
